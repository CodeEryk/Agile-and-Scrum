# **Everything on Agile and Scrum!**

## What is Agile?

Agile consists of a number of different approaches to software development. 

It is a process in which you work towards shorter term goals and getting them done, implementing them into the program allowing the client to use the program even though it’s not
complete.

Agile is a set of values and principles. Much of the discussion around Agile has to do with following different practices, using various methodologies, and even developing with specific tools. While these things might help a team that is trying to follow Agile, they aren’t Agile in and of themselves.

Agile is really a collection of beliefs that teams can use for making decisions about how to do the work for developing software. Agile gives a foundation that teams can use to make decisions that result in better software development.
