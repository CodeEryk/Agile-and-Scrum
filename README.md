# **Everything on Agile and Scrum !**

## What is Agile?
<br>
Agile consists of a number of different approaches to software development. 

It is a process in which you work towards shorter term goals and getting them done, implementing them into the program allowing the client to use the program even though it’s not
complete.

Agile is a set of values and principles. Much of the discussion around Agile has to do with following different practices, using various methodologies, and even developing with specific tools. While these things might help a team that is trying to follow Agile, they aren’t Agile in and of themselves.

Agile is really a collection of beliefs that teams can use for making decisions about how to do the work for developing software. Agile doesn't make decisions for you, instead it gives a foundation that teams can use to make decisions that result in better software development.

## The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is built up of 12 principles, as well as some key values. It can be seen as the basis of Agile. It supports the idea that software can be developed better by valuing the items on the left side of the list below, more than the items on the right side.

**Individuals and Interactions** | **Over Processes and Tools**
**Working Software** | **Over Comprehensive Documentation**
**Customer Collaboration** | **Over Contract Negotiation**
**Responding to Change** | **Over Following a Plan**
<br>
While there **is** value in the items on the right, the items on the left are valued **more**

## The 12 Principles of Agile

* **There are 12 prominent principles to consider for Agile. These principles are:**

1. **The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.**

1. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.**

1. **Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.**

1. **Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.**

1. **Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.**

1. **The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.**

1. **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**

1. **Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**

1. **Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.**

1. **Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.**

1. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.**

1. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.**
