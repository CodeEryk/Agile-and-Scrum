## What is Agile?

Agile consists of a number of different approaches to software development. 

It is a process in which you work towards shorter term goals and getting them done, implementing them into the program allowing the client to use the program even though it’s not
complete.

Agile is a set of values and principles. Much of the discussion around Agile has to do with following different practices, using various methodologies, and even developing with specific tools. While these things might help a team that is trying to follow Agile, they aren’t Agile in and of themselves.

Agile is really a collection of beliefs that teams can use for making decisions about how to do the work for developing software. Agile doesn't make decisions for you, instead it gives a foundation that teams can use to make decisions that result in better software development.

## The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is built up of 12 principles, as well as some key values. It can be seen as the basis of Agile. It supports the idea that software can be developed better by valuing the items on the left side of the list below, more than the items on the right side.

Individuals and Interactions | Over Processes and Tools
Working Software | Over Comprehensive Documentation
Customer Collaboration | Over Contract Negotiation
Responding to Change | Over Following a Plan

While there **is** value in the items on the right, the items on the left are valued **more**

## The 12 Principles of Agile

* **There are 12 prominent principles to consider for Agile. These principles are:**

1. **The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.**

1. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.**

1. **Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.**

1. **Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.**

1. **Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.**

1. **The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.**

1. **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**

1. **Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**

1. **Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.**

1. **Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.**

1. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.**

1. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.**

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together, and to get work done.

It encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organise while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve, using failures as a learning experience in order to springboard off them and move towards success.

Principles and lessons of scrum can be applied to all kinds of teamwork; however it is prominent in software development.

Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work together to help teams structure and manage their work. Customers can sometimes stray from scrum fundamentals to fit their specific needs.

## Sprints

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period where a Scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. They are at the very heart of Scrum and Agile methodologies.

A product is typically built in a series of iterations that break down big complex projects into smaller pieces. This makes projects more manageable, allows teams to ship high quality work faster and more frequently and gives them more flexibility to adapt and change. This is what a sprint is.

Sprint helps teams to follow the agile principle of “delivering working software frequently” as well as live the agile value of “responding to change over following a plan.”

## Sprint Planning

Sprint planning, as the name suggests, is used to plan an upcoming sprint. Sprint planning is typically the first step in Scrum which creates the starting line for a sprint by setting the agenda and focal point. Sprint planning is a collaborative event where a number of things are decided. During sprint planning, the team answers some questions: What work can get done in this sprint (what is the sprint goal) and how will the chosen work get done? How long is the time box going to be? What is the starting point for the planned sprint going to be?
